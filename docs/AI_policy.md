# ü§ñ AI Usage Policy

## üîç Purpose of the Policy

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools‚Äîsuch as language models, code generators, image analyzers, and virtual tutors‚Äîcan be powerful supports for learning. However, when misused, they can hinder understanding and compromise academic integrity. This policy provides guidance on how you may and may not use AI tools in this course.

## **GenAI Usage Levels**

USAFA defines seven levels of GenAI use. **Unless otherwise stated, this course operates at Level 2** (Use of GenAI for brainstorming or idea generation).

| **Level** | **Descriptor**                                            | **What this looks like in practice**                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Level 0** | No use of GenAI                                           | Cadets will create their own, original work without the use of GenAI in any manner. |
| **Level 1** | Organizational / Explanatory use of GenAI                 | Cadets will create their own, original work without the use of GenAI for submitted assignments; however, the use of GenAI for personal efficiency (i.e., summarizing notes/readings, clarifying content) is acceptable. If later used to support an assignment, this use should be acknowledged in documentation statements.|
| **Level 2** | Use of GenAI for brainstorming or idea generation | Cadets may consult GenAI as a tool for initial brainstorming or idea generation, but are expected to create their own, original work without the use of GenAI. Use of GenAI in this manner should be acknowledged as part of documentation statements. |
| **Level 3** | Use of GenAI as a feedback tool on student-generated work | Cadets create their own work independently, then may use GenAI as a tool to get feedback about their draft, such as suggestions for improvement, clarification, alignment with the assignment instructions, or editing tips. Cadets are expected to make their own revisions based on this feedback; the submitted work should not include GenAI-generated text. This use of GenAI should be clearly communicated in their documentation statements. |
| **Level 4** | Use of GenAI to co-create and/or revise work | Cadets may use GenAI to develop drafts, outlines, or provide suggested revisions to their drafts, but they must critically evaluate, revise, and take ownership of the content. Submitted work should reflect the cadet‚Äôs understanding, not unedited AI output. This use of GenAI must be clearly documented, specifying how GenAI contributed and what the cadet did to revise or evaluate that content. |
| **Level 5** | Unrestricted, attributed use of GenAI | Cadets may submit work that includes unedited or heavily AI-generated content. The emphasis is on transparency, not authorship. The extent and nature of GenAI use must be clearly disclosed with proper attribution in a documentation statement.  |
| **Level 6** | Unrestricted, unattributed use of GenAI  | Cadets may use GenAI freely without attribution unless otherwise specified. Note: While it is possible to use GenAI in an unrestricted manner without attribution, any who apply this level in their course should carefully consider ethical and legal implications. |

## ‚úÖ **Permitted Uses of AI Tools**

You may use AI tools to support your learning in the following ways:

* **Understanding concepts**: You may use AI to clarify or rephrase ideas from lectures, textbooks, or assignments.
* **Studying terminology**: You may use AI to look up technical terms, definitions, or basic principles (e.g., "What are the applications of Bayes‚Äô theorem?" or "Explain the Nyquist theorem").
* **Generating practice material**: You may ask AI tools to help you quiz yourself or create practice problems.
* **Learning by example**: You may ask for general examples that help you better understand topics like digital signal processing, circuit analysis, or embedded systems.
* **Debugging support**: You may use AI tools to help interpret error messages or learn syntax‚Äîso long as the work remains your own.

---

## ‚ùå **Prohibited Uses of AI Tools**

You may **not** use AI tools in the following ways:

* **To generate solutions for assignments, labs, projects, or exams**: Do not submit any code, calculations, diagrams, or written responses that were produced wholly or partially by an AI system.
* **To rewrite AI-generated work to pass as original**: Rephrasing or editing AI output and submitting it as your own still constitutes unauthorized assistance.
* **To avoid doing your own analysis**: Submitting AI-generated responses without fully understanding them undermines your learning and violates academic expectations.

---

## üéì **Rationale Behind the Policy**

* **You‚Äôre here to learn**: Engineering courses are designed to build your problem-solving and critical thinking skills. AI shortcuts can prevent you from developing the abilities you'll need as a professional.
* **Integrity is essential**: Submitting work you didn't produce yourself‚Äîeven if assisted by an AI‚Äîis a form of **academic dishonesty**, similar to plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration.
* **AI tools are not neutral**: While AI can explain topics, it can also make errors or generate misleading content. Relying on it too heavily can give you a false sense of understanding.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Consequences for Violating This Policy**

If you misuse AI tools in this course, you may face consequences including:

* Receiving a zero on the assignment or project
* Being reported for academic misconduct
* Further disciplinary actions under USAFA academic integrity policy

---

## üí¨ **If You‚Äôre Unsure**

If you're unsure whether your use of AI is appropriate, ask the instructor **before using it**. If you wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable explaining your process in front of the class, it‚Äôs probably not within policy.

---

## ‚úÖ **How to Use AI Tools Responsibly**

Use AI as a support, not a shortcut:

* Treat it like a tutor, not a teammate.
* Ask it to help you **understand** the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù or ‚Äúhow‚Äù‚Äînot to **do** the work for you.
* Verify everything it tells you against your notes, textbook, or instructor guidance.
* Keep notes on how you use AI while studying, in case you need to explain your process.

## üß† Final Words

AI will be a tool in your future engineering career‚Äîbut learning to **use it responsibly and ethically** is essential. This course supports your growth, and that means **doing the hard work yourself** when it matters.

Let‚Äôs use technology wisely‚Äîwith integrity, curiosity, and responsibility.
